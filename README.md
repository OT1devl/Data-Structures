- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Sets
- Maps (Dictionaries)

---

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **C++**
- **Java**

---

### 📚 **Learning Outcomes**
By exploring this repository, you'll be able to:

- Understand how each data structure works under the hood.
- Learn how to implement and optimize these structures.
- Compare the implementations across Python, C++, and Java to gain insights into language-specific features.

---

### 🚀 **Future Plans**
